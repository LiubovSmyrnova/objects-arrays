        In this exercise you will work with objects and arrays.


Start by creating an object that is called 'me' and should have the following properties:

 'firstName' that should be the data type string.

 'lastName' that should be the data type string.

'age' that should be the data type number.

'job' that should be the data type string.

'pets' that should be the data type array. Include any amount of pets that you like in this array.


Use the object and log a string like this to the console:

"My name is xx xx and I'm xx years old xx. I have xx pets at home." 

Replace the xx with the proper object property.


Tweak the text to match the job or occupation that you put in your object. 


Use a ternary to decide what you should print in the sentence based on how many pets you have. For example if you only have on pet then you should not log "I have 1 pets"... instead use singular pet. If you have no pets then you should probably log something like: "I have no pets."


Challenge:

Create a new property to the object called 'logSelf' which should be a function. Use this function property to log the information about yourself to the console instead of using console.log to output a string to the console. 

When calling for the properties within the object you need to use the this keyword.
